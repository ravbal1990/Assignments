            <h2>Dates</h2>
            Dates have been cultivated for more than 7,000 years and are considered sacred throughout
            ancient civilizations, so it is no surprise that they are eaten most during Ramadan.
            The fruit has sustained generations and has become an integral part of the UAEs heritage and identity.
            Also, according to Islamic tradition, a date tree was said to be the “Tree of Life.” Dates are incredibly
            rich in iron, which is excellent for building the quality and strength of the blood.

            A dish consumed by pharaohs, warriors and sultans, the hummus has come a long way to become the traditional
            and symbolic dish in Arab cuisine.
            Roughly translated, hummus means “chickpeas”, but the dip we eat today is more accurately known as hummus bi
            tahini or tahina.
            It is typically made by blending chickpeas (garbanzo beans), tahini (ground sesame seeds), olive oil, lemon
            juice and garlic.
            It is Vegan, Gluten-free, High in fiber, Protein and truly delicious!

            <h2>Baklava</h2>
            Baklava is a rich, sweet pastry featured in many cuisines of Dubai. It is made of layers of phyllo dough
            filled with chopped nuts, such as
            walnuts, almonds, and sweetened with syrup.
            It is said that the Sultans presented trays of baklava to the Janissaries every 15th of the month of Ramadan
            in a ceremonial procession
            called the Baklava Alayı. Though, the origin of
            baklava has continued to be disputed, since many ethnic groups claim this delicious, exotic dish as their
            own.
